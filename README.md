# Cylinder-server
This is the server side implementation to access the file system of a user and communicate it to a web frontend.
The server aims to support the handling of multiple users in a secure manor.

This is being developed as part as a degree project, the public is welcomed to contribute code baring in mind that
my (Adam) design, or code may not be perfect.
Be sure to note the development methodology is based around test-driven development (TDD) - expect a lot of tests to 
fail in the early days.

The TDD tests are run from /tests/ in files created according to categories defined in the system requirements 
specification and test plan (in docs/wiki).
Unit tests are also being created (TDD != unit tests in advance) in /tests/unit/.
